                <h2>Imago Dei and AI as Tool</h2>
                <div class="article-excerpt">
                    <p>One crucial aspect of Christian doctrine is the concept of the Imago Dei...</p>
                </div>
                <div class="article-full" id="article1Full">
                    <p>One crucial aspect of Christian doctrine is the concept of the Imago Dei, or being made in the image of God. This means that humans hold a unique, non-negotiable value and role in creation, setting us apart from every other creature on earth. When I consider this truth, I realize that it shapes the way I should view Artificial Intelligence. AI is ultimately a powerful tool, created by us, the image-bearers, and designed to help us in our work. I feel that viewing it in this way prevents it from becoming an idol or a distraction from our primary calling: to glorify God and exercise responsible dominion. Another element that ties into this understanding is the need for humility and responsibility. Oftentimes, when we create something powerful, we are tempted to either depend on it too heavily or treat it with too much admiration. This means that we must maintain a clear distinction between the created and the Creator, and between the human and the machine. One thing that helps me keep my perspective clear is the strong personal boundary of never treating AI like a human or personifying it. This keeps the focus where it should be: on AI as a function of code and data, not as a conscious entity. The ability to reason, to experience emotion, and to bear God’s image is exclusively ours; we diminish our own value when we mistakenly grant those attributes to a machine. However, recognizing AI as a tool also comes with the responsibility to use it well. This leads me to believe that a practice focused on humility is essential. Generally, I’ve found that the simple practice of praying before starting an assignment checks my pride and dependence on AI. This reminds me that true wisdom and understanding come from God, not from the algorithms I am about to engage with. It also affirms that I am asking for help to use the tool ethically and thoughtfully, rather than relying on it to bypass the mental effort that my professor, and God, expects me to put forth. Ultimately, being made in God’s image means that we are called to be wise, discerning stewards of the technology we create. This commitment to the Imago Dei provides a clear ethical framework: we can embrace the capabilities of AI while simultaneously maintaining the profound, spiritual distance between ourselves and the technology. Overall, by keeping a boundary that guards the uniqueness of human personhood and by engaging in a practice that fosters humility, I can ensure I am using AI to contribute positively to my academic and spiritual growth.</p>

                <h2>Verifying AI Claims in Web Development</h2>
                <div class="article-excerpt">
                    <p>One task I am completing this term is creating a website for my Conversations with AI class...</p>
                </div>
                <div class="article-full" id="article2Full">
                    <p>One task I am completing this term is creating a website for my Conversations with AI class. This project requires me to write HTML code to build a functional site that showcases my work and understanding of AI tools. I am using AI assistants like ChatGPT or Claude not only to help me troubleshoot coding issues and explain web development concepts, but also to actually write the code for my website. These tools can generate entire sections of code based on my prompts, suggest design implementations, and create functionality that would take me much longer to write manually. However, one crucial aspect of working with AI on technical projects is recognizing where these tools might provide inaccurate information. AI models can confidently suggest outdated coding practices, recommend deprecated libraries, or even hallucinate documentation that doesn't actually exist. This means that I need to verify the claims AI makes about web development before implementing them into my project. One major area where AI might be inaccurate is in recommending specific code libraries or frameworks. AI models are trained on data up to a certain cutoff date, which means they might suggest tools or methods that are no longer supported or have been replaced by better alternatives. Another thing that could lead to problems is when AI provides code snippets that contain syntax errors or use outdated syntax from older versions of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Oftentimes, AI will generate code that looks correct at first glance but fails when you actually try to run it in a browser. AI might also misunderstand the context of my question and provide a solution that technically works but doesn't follow best practices for accessibility, security, or performance. Since I am relying on AI to write significant portions of my code, these inaccuracies could compromise the entire functionality of my website if I don't catch them. In order to verify the information AI provides, I will use several strategies to fact-check claims before implementing them. When AI recommends a specific library or framework, I will check the official documentation and GitHub repository to see if it's actively maintained and used. Another verification method is testing the code in a Claude artifact window before adding it to my final project. This allows me to see if the code actually works as intended and doesn't break other parts of my website. I will also take advantage of my professor's expertise by asking questions during office hours when AI gives me advice that seems questionable or contradicts what I've learned in class. The Bible emphasizes the importance of truthfulness and careful verification in Proverbs 18:17, which states, "The one who states his case first seems right, until the other comes and examines him." This principle applies directly to working with AI because these tools often present information with confidence, making their first answer seem correct even when it might be flawed. Just as this proverb warns against accepting the first claim without examination, I need to examine AI's suggestions critically rather than assuming they're accurate just because they sound authoritative. As a Christian, I understand that pursuing truth requires diligence and wisdom, not just accepting whatever information is most convenient or appears first. This biblical principle reminds me that verifying claims isn't about distrusting AI entirely, but about being a responsible steward of the tools and information I have access to. Ultimately, my commitment to truthfulness means taking the extra time to fact-check and verify before I present my website project as my own work.</p>

                <h2>Protecting Privacy in AI-Assisted Business Tasks</h2>
                <div class="article-excerpt">
                    <p>As someone pursuing a career in business, I will encounter numerous situations where I need to use AI tools to complete tasks more efficiently...</p>
                </div>
                <div class="article-full" id="article3Full">
                    <p>As someone pursuing a career in business, I will encounter numerous situations where I need to use AI tools to complete tasks more efficiently. However, one crucial aspect of using AI in a business context is understanding when private details might appear in prompts or outputs and how to protect the personal information of clients and employees. In my vocation, I will likely work with sensitive financial data when conducting analysis for clients and handle confidential information during employee recruitment processes. Both of these areas involve personal details that could easily end up in AI prompts if I'm not careful about what information I share with these tools. One situation where private details might appear is during financial analysis projects. When analyzing a client's financial situation or investment portfolio, I might be tempted to input specific account numbers, social security numbers, or detailed transaction histories into an AI tool to help me identify patterns or generate reports. Another scenario is during employee recruitment, where I might want to use AI to help screen resumes or assess candidate responses. In this context, I could accidentally include applicants' full names, addresses, phone numbers, or employment histories in my prompts. Oftentimes, it seems efficient to copy and paste entire documents into AI tools without thinking about what sensitive information those documents contain. There are certain types of information I will never include in AI prompts, regardless of how helpful it might seem. I will never include other people's personal details without their explicit consent, including full names, contact information, identification numbers, or financial account details. When working with financial data, I will anonymize all identifying information before using AI assistance, replacing real names with labels like "Client A" and removing specific account numbers entirely. However, I recognize that some business services genuinely benefit from AI assistance. In these cases, I will obtain clear, informed consent from the individuals involved before using AI tools. For financial analysis services, I will explain to clients exactly how I plan to use AI and what information will be shared. For recruitment processes, I will inform candidates that AI tools may be used and give them the option to opt out. The principle of loving your neighbor, found in Matthew 22:39 where Jesus commands us to "love your neighbor as yourself," applies directly to how I handle other people's private information. This means that I should treat others' personal details with the same care and protection I would want for my own sensitive information. As a Christian, I understand that loving my neighbor means respecting their dignity and protecting their interests. When I handle someone's financial information or employment details, I am holding something valuable that they have entrusted to me. Ultimately, this biblical principle reminds me that efficiency should never come at the expense of respecting the people I serve.

                    <p>As I create my website for my Conversations with AI class, one crucial aspect of the project is handling ownership, licensing, and attribution properly for all the text and images I use. This means I need to understand who owns the content on my site, what permissions I have to use materials created by others, and how to give proper credit to the original creators. Since I am using AI tools to generate much of my website's code and potentially some written content, I also need to consider how AI-generated material fits into these ownership questions. Additionally, I will likely want to include images, graphics, or other visual elements that make my site more engaging and professional-looking, which means I need to find sources that allow me to use their work legally and ethically. For text content on my website, I will primarily create original writing or use AI-generated content, both of which I have the right to use freely. However, if I quote or reference ideas from other sources like articles, books, or academic papers, I will provide clear attribution with the author's name and source information. For images and graphics, I will only use materials that are either my own original creations, AI-generated, or available under licenses that permit reuse. One Creative Commons license I might use is CC BY (Attribution), which allows me to use images freely as long as I give proper credit to the creator. This license is ideal for my website because it provides flexibility to modify and use images in different contexts while still honoring the original creator's work through attribution. When I use a CC BY image, I will include a caption or footer credit that lists the creator's name, the image title if available, and a link back to the original source. The Bible provides clear guidance about honoring others' work in Exodus 20:15, which states, "You shall not steal." This commandment applies not only to physical possessions but also to intellectual property and creative work. As a Christian, I understand that using someone else's writing, images, or ideas without permission or proper attribution is a form of theft because it takes credit or value that rightfully belongs to the creator. When I give proper attribution and follow licensing requirements, I am showing respect for the time, skill, and creativity that others invested in their work. Ultimately, handling ownership and attribution carefully is about treating others the way I would want to be treated if I were the creator.</p>

                <h2>Maintaining Authorship in AI-Assisted Work</h2>

                    <p>After completing my midterm demo for the website project, I can clearly identify which parts of my artifact were my own original work and which parts were AI-assisted. The components that were entirely mine included my basketball statistics, my resume, and part of my ways to support me section. These elements contained my personal information, experiences, and achievements that only I could provide because they came directly from my life and background. However, other parts of my website relied heavily on AI assistance. The articles I wrote were AI-assisted, meaning I provided prompts and direction but the actual writing was generated by AI tools. My thank you section was also AI-assisted, where I used AI to help craft the message and tone I wanted to convey. This raises an important question about authorship: when so much of my website includes AI-generated content, how did I stay the author of this project? I remained the author of my website even with significant AI assistance because I maintained control over the direction, content, and decisions throughout the entire process. One thing that kept me as the author was that I provided all the ideas, topics, and personal information that shaped what appeared on the site. The basketball statistics, resume details, and personal elements came from my own life, and even when AI helped write articles or thank you messages, I was the one deciding what those sections should communicate. Another aspect that preserved my authorship was my active role in reviewing and revising AI-generated content. I didn't simply accept whatever the AI produced; instead, I evaluated whether the output matched my intentions, made sense for my audience, and accurately represented what I wanted to say. This means I was curating and directing the AI rather than passively receiving its work. Looking ahead, I have a plan for keeping my voice in future work that involves AI assistance. One crucial strategy is using my style guide to ensure that AI-generated writing matches my natural tone, word choice, and sentence patterns. By providing AI tools with specific instructions about how I write, I can make sure the output sounds like something I would actually say rather than generic content. Another method is always starting with my own ideas and outline before asking AI to help with drafting. This keeps me in the driver's seat creatively. Additionally, I will continue to review and edit all AI-generated content carefully, making changes that align with my voice and removing anything that doesn't feel authentic to who I am as a writer. Ultimately, staying the author means maintaining creative control and decision-making authority throughout the entire process.

                <h2>Addressing AI Bias in Business Decisions</h2>
                <div class="article-excerpt">
                    <p>One likely bias in AI tools related to my field of business is that these systems are heavily biased toward analytics and data-driven decisions...</p>

                <div class="article-full" id="article6Full">
                    <p>One likely bias in AI tools related to my field of business is that these systems are heavily biased toward analytics and data-driven decisions while lacking the ability to show genuine empathy or understand human context. AI models excel at processing numbers, identifying patterns in datasets, and making recommendations based purely on quantitative metrics. However, this analytical bias means there are situations where AI could make decisions improperly because of its computer nature, failing to account for the human elements that are crucial in business contexts. This limitation becomes especially problematic in areas like employee management, customer relations, and financial advising, where empathy and understanding of individual circumstances are just as important as the numbers. A real example of this bias would be using AI to help make decisions about employee layoffs or performance evaluations. An AI tool might analyze productivity metrics, sales numbers, attendance records, and other quantifiable data to recommend which employees should be let go during budget cuts. On paper, this seems logical and objective. However, AI cannot understand that one employee's recent decline in productivity might be due to caring for a sick family member, or that another employee provides invaluable mentorship to junior staff members that doesn't show up in sales figures. Another example is in financial advising, where AI might recommend a strictly analytical investment strategy for a client without considering their emotional comfort with risk, their family situation, or their values about where they want their money invested. The AI sees only the numbers and probabilities, missing the human story behind the financial decisions. To safeguard against this bias, I will apply a simple but crucial practice: never let AI make final decisions in situations involving people without human review and consideration of context. Before implementing any AI recommendation that affects employees or clients, I will personally review the situation, talk to the individuals involved, and consider factors that AI cannot measure like relationships, circumstances, and human dignity. This means treating AI as an advisory tool rather than a decision-maker. The Bible provides clear guidance about justice and impartiality in James 2:1-4, which warns against showing favoritism and judging by appearances alone. This principle reminds me that true justice requires looking beyond surface-level metrics to see people as individuals with unique circumstances. As a Christian, I understand that every person has inherent worth and dignity that cannot be reduced to data points or productivity numbers. When AI makes recommendations based solely on analytics, it risks treating people as mere statistics rather than as individuals created in God's image. Ultimately, biblical justice calls me to balance efficiency with empathy and to ensure that business decisions honor the full humanity of everyone involved.</p>
